 This study presents a novel approach to plant disease detection using multimodal ensemble learning.  
 By integrating color, grayscale, and segmented images processed through deep learning models like Inception and VGG16 via
 transfer learning, we achieve a 96% accuracy rate. Our method enhances
 disease detection reliability and demonstrates the potential of ensemble
 techniques in agriculture. This research contributes to advancing plant
 disease detection technology for sustainable agriculture by providing a robust
 and accurate detection system. The findings highlight the effectiveness of
 combining diverse modalities and ensemble learning for addressing complex
 agricultural challenges.

The project aims to revolutionize plant disease detection by leveraging 
cutting-edge deep learning techniques. Through the fusion of multi
modal ensemble learning and transfer learning, we seek to develop a 
robust system capable of accurately identifying diseases in plants based 
on color, grayscale, and segmented leaf images. By harnessing the power 
of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG16 and InceptionV3, 
we aim to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency in disease 
classification.
