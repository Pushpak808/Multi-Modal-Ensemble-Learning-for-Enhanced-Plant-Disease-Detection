 This study presents a novel approach to plant disease detection using multi
  - modal ensemble learning. By integrating color, grayscale, and segmented
 images processed through deep learning models like Inception and VGG16 via
 transfer learning, we achieve a 96% accuracy rate. Our method enhances
 disease detection reliability and demonstrates the potential of ensemble
 techniques in agriculture. This research contributes to advancing plant
 disease detection technology for sustainable agriculture by providing a robust
 and accurate detection system. The findings highlight the effectiveness of
 combining diverse modalities and ensemble learning for addressing complex
 agricultural challenges.
